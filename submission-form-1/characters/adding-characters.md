# Adding Characters

The characters page will let you manage the characters that feature in the work. Adding existing characters, creating new characters, and assigning their roles and voice actors are all done here.

### Add Characters

The popup after pressing the ‘_Add Characters_’ button will let you search for the character you want to link, which you can then select and confirm. Back on the main page, you’ll now be able to add a role and voice actor.

### Import

This will let you import every character and voice actor from another entry, which you can then modify as necessary.

#### Character Role

Each character has the option to be set as a _main_, _supporting_, or _background_ character. For many of these, it will be up to your own judgement.
