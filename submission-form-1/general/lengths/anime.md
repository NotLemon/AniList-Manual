# Anime

### Episodes

The final episode count of the anime. This should be kept blank until an official count has been provided, but can be altered if there are further announcements of episodes within the same series.

### Episode Duration

Please use the average length \(_**mode**_\) of episodes, rounded to the nearest minute. The 23-25 mark is standard for most TV anime. This can be left blank until a full length episode has been released.

The mean duration can be used for entries with wildly varied lengths, such as [Genius Party](https://anilist.co/anime/3508/GeniusParty).
