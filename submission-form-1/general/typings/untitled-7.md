Example:

> The light novel [Ookami to Koushinryou](https://anilist.co/manga/39115/Ookami-to-Koushinryou/) was the first published release of the series, so it would have the '**Original**' source.
>
> It then has both [anime](https://anilist.co/anime/2966/Ookami-to-Koushinryou/) and [manga](https://anilist.co/manga/33299/Ookami-to-Koushinryou/) adaptations announced. Both of these would be given the '**Light Novel**' source.   
>   
> Any further spin-off's and similar relations would also be sourced to the light novel.
