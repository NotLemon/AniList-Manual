# Staff Role

Choose the role that the staff member had in the work. If the staff member had multiple roles, you will need to add the staff member themselves multiple times.

### **Anime**

In terms of anime, for staff, if they have specific episode credits, they should be credited in the following formats; _**‘Storyboard \(ep 5\)**_’ or ‘_**2nd Key Animation \(eps 1, 3, 8, 11, 13\)**_’ with a comma, followed by a space after every episode number. If they are credited with a studio next to their name, do not include the studio. If they are credited for at least 3 consecutive episodes then it should be formatted as ‘_**Animation Director \(eps 7-9\)**_’.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Keep in mind that some titles do not follow conventional episode credits \([Panty & Stocking with Garterbelt](https://anilist.co/anime/8795/Panty--Stocking-with-Garterbelt/) or [Princess Tutu](https://anilist.co/anime/721/Princess-Tutu/) are both good examples\). Care should be taken to convert episode credits into how [AniList ](http://anilist.co)lists episodes. 

For example, [Princess Tutu](https://anilist.co/anime/721/Princess-Tutu/) is often credited as if it were a 26 episode anime but [AniList ](http://anilist.co)lists it as 38 as episodes. Episodes 14 to 37 were aired as 12 minute long episodes. A credit of ‘_**In-Between Check \(ep 26\)**_’ elsewhere might be ‘In-Between Check \(ep 38\)’ on [AniList](http://anilist.co), you’ll need to determine the convention used on the site you’re pulling the data from. Conversely, for a title like [Panty & Stocking with Garterbelt](https://anilist.co/anime/8795/Panty--Stocking-with-Garterbelt/), a credit for ‘_**Episode Director \(ep 2\)**_’ would be ‘_**Episode Director \(ep 1b\)**_’.

### Manga

In terms of manga, for staff, credit writers with '_**Story'**_ and illustrators with '_**Art'**_. If a creator is both, credit them with '_**Story and Art'**_.

{% hint style="warning" %}
For spin-offs and related works undertaken by other authors and artists, you will need to use the _**Original Work**_ or _**Character Design**_ roles. This will almost always apply to anime adaptations.
