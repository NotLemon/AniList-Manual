### Given Name

Their given name\(s\) in correct [romanisation](../../media-specification/romanisation.md).

### Surname

Their surname or alias in correct [romanisation](../../media-specification/romanisation.md).

### Native Name

For native names, the order should be ‘_**Surname Given Name**_’ without spaces.

Example: 

> [Eriko Kimura](https://anilist.co/staff/105138/Eriko-Kimura)’s native name field should be '木村絵理子' \(KimuraEriko\).
>
> A lot of current entries are incorrectly written as '絵理子木村' \(ErikoKimura\), which is the wrong way round, or '木村 絵理子' \(Kimura Eriko\), which contains a space. So, if you see it, please try to correct it.

[Dictionary browser extensions](../../media-specification/sourcing/tools/rikaichan-and-rikaikun.md) can help with kanji readings if you know hiragana. if not, then feel free to ask for help in [Discord](http://discord.me/anilist).
{% endhint %}

An exception to the above is when a name is natively western.

Example:

> ‘[Reinhard von Lohengramm](https://anilist.co/character/3066/Reinhard-von-Lohengramm)’ would be written as _ラインハルト・フォン・ローグラム_. Keep in mind the rules of the language the name is born from, as terms like '_von'_ and '_van_' in German would be tacked onto the start of the surname.   
>   
> Additionally, any middle names should be placed at the end of the given name.

### Language

The language that the staff member performs or works in. This is currently only used and displayed for Voice Actor language.

### About

A basic description of the person, it can be hometown, birthday, hobbies and interests, social media links, blogs etc.  
Example: [Tatari Takayama](https://anilist.co/staff/128291/Tatari-Takayama)

### Image

This is the cover image for the staff member.   
  
A clean headshot or head and shoulders portrait photo should be used where possible.  
  
Format should either .jpg \(.jpeg\) or .png.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Covers should be as close a 2:3 ratio as possible.   
  
If you have to crop or create new images then 230x345px is the recommended minimum. Larger images will be downscaled to 230px width.  
  
Please refer to [Image Dimensions and Templates](../../media-specification/image-dimensions-and-template.md), if required.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
For many staff, images such as Twitter, Pixiv, or personal blog avatars can be suitable replacements if a photo portrait doesn’t exist. Cropping these isn’t required   
  
Example: [Yamakawa Naoto](https://anilist.co/staff/105479/Naoto-Yamakawa), [Takayama Tatari](https://anilist.co/staff/128291/Tatari-Takayama)
