# YouTube Preview ID

Only _**official**_ videos by a rights-holder will be accepted, while this can be a CM, a PV is preferred when possible.

{% hint style="info" %}
If the video has been region-locked, then [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/) re-uploads or [Dailymotion](https://www.dailymotion.com/) uploads are accepted.
{% endhint %}

The ID is located at the end of the [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/) video URL.

For example, the ID for [https://www.YouTube.com/watch?v=fq3abPnEEGE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fq3abPnEEGE) is `fq3abPnEEGE`  
To add a [Dailymotion](https://www.dailymotion.com/gb) video, prefix the [Dailymotion](https://www.dailymotion.com/gb) video ID with `dm--`
