# Title Formatting

There should be _consistent_ formatting when converting from and/or using native and romaji titles.

## Title Modification

### **Unconfirmed Titles for Additional Seasons**

For works getting a new series or season and the official title is as of yet unconfirmed, or never confirmed, please append the series number alone to the end of native and romaji titles, and 'Season X' to the end of the English title.

Example

> A [third season](https://anilist.co/anime/99147/Shingeki-no-Kyojin-3/) is announced but not given any proper titles. Until then the titles would be:  
>   
> Native: 進撃の巨人３  
> Romaji: Shingeki no Kyojin 3  
> English: Attack on Titan Season 3

### **Split Seasons**

If a 'season' of the show will air for multiple seasons, but has at least a one [airing season](../submission-form/general/release-data/season.md) gap in between. The subsequent entries should have 'Part 2' or equivalent if no official title is given.

Example

> The third season began airing in Summer 2018, but misses Fall 2018, Winter 2019 and [continues](https://anilist.co/anime/104578/Shingeki-no-Kyojin-3-Part-2/) in Spring 2019. The titles would be:  
>   
> Native: 進撃の巨人３  
> Romaji: Shingeki no Kyojin 3 Part 2  
> English: Attack on Titan Season 3 Part 2

### **Appendages**

For supplemental works to a main series, such as [OVAs and Specials](animated-media-information/ovas-and-onas.md), the main series title should be used and the format appended to the end.

Example:

> '[Fate/kaleid liner Prisma☆Illya](https://anilist.co/anime/14829/Fatekaleid-liner-PrismaIllya/)' has a side story with the title '[Fate/kaleid liner Prisma☆Illya Specials](https://anilist.co/anime/19109/Fatekaleid-liner-PrismaIllya-Specials/)'.

## Untitled or Provisionally Titled Media

It is fine to add newly announced original work with no title or a provisional title providing there is still an official source to verify it. This is most common in manga magazines where announcements can be made for an author's new work months in advance.

If the media has no title, please use `(Title to be Announced)` in the romaji and native fields.

If the media has a provisional title, please append `(Provisional Title)` to the end of the romaji title, and `（仮）`to the end of the native title.

It is highly recommended to write a temporary description containing the date of the announcement, a link to a reputable article or website, and the author.

**Example:**

```text
<i>serialization of Shouto Aya's new work - announced 2018/10/25 - presently untitled.</i>
<br>
<a href="http://www.ganganonline.com/contents/big32018/">Announcement Link</a>
```

{% hint style="warning" %}
Remember to follow news for the series so that the title can be updated as soon as possible.

## Special Characters

{% hint style="info" %}
Examples of how to deal with non-alphanumeric characters in titles can be seen in the table below. If uncertain, contact a [moderator](../moderator-list.md).
{% endhint %}

* Titles which feature subtitles separated full-width tildes \(～\) or other similar separators should be separated with a colon.  
* Japanese quotes \(「」\) should be converted to English double-quotes \(" "\).  
* Symbols like stars \(☆\) and musical notes \(♪\) should remain.  
* Titles using full-width tildes to elongate words should be [romanized](romanization.md) without. \(み〜つけた &gt; Mitsuketa\).  
* Hashtags in titles should remain without spaces when [romanized](romanization.md), however, a version with spaces should ideally be placed in the synonyms.  
* Special things such as kaomoji \(顔文字\) should not be [romanized](romanization.md).
