# Web Platform List Examples

The below list contains examples of popular web platforms or self-publishing services that often cause confusion on whether the series is allowed or not. It is mostly for referencing rather than a complete list of what is or is not allowed and can be expanded.

{% hint style="info" %}
If one of the below accepted links exist, please add them to the [External Links](../../submission-form/external-links.md). Additionally, [Mavo ](https://www.mavo.co.jp/)and [Pixiv](http://pixiv.net), and [Twitter](http://twitter.com/) links can still be used for eligible [doujinshi](doujinshi.md).
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
As always, works still have to satisfy the Japanese, Chinese, Korean, or Taiwanese ‘[Country Of Origin](../../submission-form/general/typings/country-of-origin.md)’ type.
{% endhint %}

If the work originally published on ‘_Not Accepted_‘ websites is later picked up by a professional publisher of _**the same language**_, that later publication would be what can be added to the database.
